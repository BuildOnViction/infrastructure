# infrastructure: localnet

üèóÔ∏è Work in progress üöß

This is the localnet branch of the Tomochain infrastructure.

This repo holds the dockerized infrastructure meant to be used to test local development.

## Requirements

- Docker

## Initialize

Before deploying, you need to fill in some passwords and private values who can't be versioned.
You can run the `init.sh` multiple times, just keep in minds it will overwrite all the file on each runs.

```
git clone https://github.com/tomochain/infrastructure.git
cd infrastructure
git checkout localnet

./init.sh
```

Also, if you don't need the whole infrastructure, feel free to edit `deploy.sh`, `redeploy.sh`, `undeploy.sh` and `logs.sh` to remove the unwanted docker-compose files.

## Deploy

To build the images, create the containers and start them, simply run `deploy.sh`.

```
./deploy.sh

./logs.sh       # if you want to follow the logs
```

## Access

- Grafana: http://localhost:port
-
- Tomomaster:
- Tomoscan:

## Workflow

This is subject to change. The goal is to reduce manual steps.

Exemple with the tomochain repo:

- Work in your project repo
- Build the repo base image `docker build -t tomochain/tomochain:latest`
- In the infrastructure folder, run `./redeploy.sh`

## Undeploy

In case you want to reset your environment, run `undeploy.sh`
```
./undeploy
```
It will prompt you for volumes pruning. It's handy for deleting all the persistent volumes created for localnet but be aware that it can also delete unrelated volumes
